# Security Policy for [PROJECT_NAME]

The security of [PROJECT_NAME] is a top priority for our organization. We are committed to ensuring our software is secure and that any vulnerabilities are addressed promptly and responsibly. This document outlines our security policy, including how to report vulnerabilities, what you can expect from us, and best practices for maintaining security.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of [PROJECT_NAME]:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| `X.Y.z` | :white_check_mark: |
| `X.Y-1.z` | :white_check_mark: |
| `< X.Y-1` | :x:                |

Please ensure you are using a supported version to receive the latest security patches. We encourage users to upgrade to the latest stable version as soon as it is released.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate and value the efforts of security researchers and users who help us maintain the security of [PROJECT_NAME].

**DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report vulnerabilities privately through one of the following methods:

1.  **Email:** Send an email to `[SECURITY_CONTACT_EMAIL_ADDRESS]` (e.g., `security@example.com`). Please use a descriptive subject line, such as "Security Vulnerability in [PROJECT_NAME]".
2.  **GitHub Security Advisories:** If you have commit access or are a collaborator, you can create a draft security advisory directly within the repository.
3.  **Dedicated Security Platform (if applicable):** If your organization uses a platform like HackerOne or Bugcrowd, provide a link here: `[LINK_TO_BUG_BOUNTY_PROGRAM]`

**What to include in your report:**

To help us understand and address the issue quickly, please include the following information in your report:

*   **Description of the vulnerability:** A clear and concise explanation of the vulnerability.
*   **Affected component(s) and version(s):** Specify which parts of [PROJECT_NAME] are affected and the versions.
*   **Steps to reproduce:** Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability. Include any proof-of-concept code, scripts, or screenshots.
*   **Potential impact:** What is the potential impact of this vulnerability (e.g., data exposure, denial of service, remote code execution)?
*   **Your contact information:** So we can follow up with you.
*   **(Optional) Suggested mitigation:** If you have ideas on how to fix the vulnerability.

**Our Commitment:**

*   We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within `[ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_TIME_FRAME]` (e.g., 2 business days).
*   We will investigate the reported vulnerability and work to validate it.
*   We will keep you informed of our progress.
*   We will publicly disclose the vulnerability and the fix once it has been addressed, typically through a security advisory and release notes. We aim to coordinate public disclosure with you.
*   We will credit you for your discovery, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Security Updates and Advisories

Security updates will be released as part of our regular release cycle or as emergency patches if the vulnerability is critical.

*   **Security Advisories:** We will publish security advisories for all confirmed vulnerabilities. These can be found at `[LINK_TO_GITHUB_SECURITY_ADVISORIES_FOR_REPO]` or `[LINK_TO_DEDICATED_SECURITY_PAGE_ON_WEBSITE]`.
*   **Release Notes:** Security fixes will be documented in the release notes for the corresponding version.
*   **Communication Channels:** Major security announcements may also be communicated via `[SECURITY_MAILING_LIST_OR_BLOG_LINK]`.

## Security Best Practices for Users and Contributors

*   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Ensure all third-party libraries and dependencies used with or within [PROJECT_NAME] are kept up-to-date.
*   **Secure Configuration:** Follow recommended security configurations for [PROJECT_NAME] and its underlying infrastructure.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to users and services interacting with [PROJECT_NAME].
*   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user-supplied input.
*   **Secrets Management:** Do not hardcode secrets (API keys, passwords, etc.) in your codebase. Use environment variables or a dedicated secrets management solution.
*   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests of your applications built with [PROJECT_NAME].

## Scope of Vulnerabilities

We are primarily interested in vulnerabilities that have a direct security impact on [PROJECT_NAME] or its users. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Remote Code Execution (RCE)
*   SQL Injection (SQLi)
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
*   Authentication or Authorization Bypass
*   Sensitive Information Exposure
*   Directory Traversal
*   Denial of Service (DoS) - if it's a novel or particularly severe DoS vector.

## Out of Scope

The following issues are generally considered out of scope for our security vulnerability program (though we may still appreciate reports for some of these for general improvement):

*   Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies that are already publicly known (please update your dependencies).
*   Vulnerabilities in outdated or unsupported versions of [PROJECT_NAME].
*   Theoretical vulnerabilities without a practical exploit path.
*   Self-XSS that cannot be used to attack other users.
*   Missing security headers that do not lead to a direct vulnerability.
*   Social engineering attacks.
*   Denial of Service vulnerabilities that require excessive resources or are common (e.g., HTTP flood without amplification).
*   Reports from automated scanners without manual verification of a real vulnerability.
*   Disclosure of public information or information that does not pose a security risk.

## Incident Response

In the event of a security breach or a severe vulnerability being exploited, our organization has an internal incident response plan. This plan includes steps for containment, eradication, recovery, and post-mortem analysis to prevent future incidents.

## Legal Safe Harbor

We consider security research and vulnerability disclosure activities conducted under this policy to be authorized. We will not pursue civil or criminal legal action against individuals who:

*   Engage in testing that does not harm [PROJECT_NAME], its users, or its data.
*   Adhere to the guidelines outlined in this policy, including private disclosure.
*   Do not exfiltrate, modify, or destroy any data.
*   Do not conduct social engineering, phishing, or physical attacks against our employees, users, or infrastructure.

## Questions

If you have any questions about this security policy, please contact us at `[GENERAL_CONTACT_EMAIL_OR_SECURITY_EMAIL]`.
